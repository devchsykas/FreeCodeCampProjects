          An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These
          usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called
          properties and methods when they are inside objects). Let's work
          through an example to understand what they look like.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin with, make a local copy of our
          <a
            href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/oojs/introduction/oojs.html"
            target="_blank"
            >oojs.html</a
          >
          file. We'll use this as a basis for exploring basic object syntax.
          While working with this example you should have your developer tools
          JavaScript console open and ready to type in some commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with many things in JavaScript, creating an object often begins
          with defining and initializing a variable.Try entering the following
          line below the JavaScript code that's already in your file, then
          saving and refreshing:
        </p>
        <code>const person = {};</code>
        <p>
          Now open your browser's JavaScript console, enter
          <span class="highlight">person</span> into it, and press
          <span class="highlight">Enter/Return</span>. You should get a result
          similar to one of the below lines:
        </p>
        <code>
          [object Object] <br />
          Object { } <br />
          { }</code
        >
        <p>
          Congratulations, you've just created your first object. Job done! But
          this is an empty object, so we can't really do much with it. Let's
          update the JavaScript object in our file to look like this:
        </p>
        <code
          >const person = { <br />
          name: ["Bob", "Smith"], <br />
          age: 32, <br />
          bio: function () { <br />
          console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years
          old.`); <br />
          }, <br />
          introduceSelf: function () { <br />
          console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name[0]}.`); <br />
          }, <br />
          };
        </code>
        <p>
          After saving and refreshing, try entering some of the following into
          the JavaScript console on your browser devtools:
        </p>
        <code>
          person.name; <br />
          person.name[0]; <br />
          person.age; <br />
          person.bio(); // "Bob Smith is 32 years old." <br />
          person.introduceSelf(); // "Hi! I'm Bob."
        </code>
        <p>
          You have now got some data and functionality inside your object, and
          are now able to access them with some nice simple syntax!
        </p>
        <p>
          So what is going on here? Well, an object is made up of multiple
          members, each of which has a name (e.g.
          <span class="highlight">name</span> and
          <span class="highlight">age</span> above), and a value (e.g.
          <span class="highlight">['Bob', 'Smith']</span> and
          <span class="highlight">32</span>). Each name/value pair must be
          separated by a comma, and the name and value in each case are
          separated by a colon. The syntax always follows this pattern:
        </p>
        <code>
          const objectName = { <br />
          member1Name: member1Value, <br />
          member2Name: member2Value, <br />
          member3Name: member3Value, <br />
          };
        </code>
        <p>
          The value of an object member can be pretty much anything — in our
          person object we've got a number, an array, and two functions. The
          first two items are data items, and are referred to as the object's
          <strong class="bold-text">properties</strong>. The last two items are
          functions that allow the object to do something with that data, and
          are referred to as the object's
          <strong class="bold-text">methods</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the object's members are functions there's a simpler syntax.
          Instead of <span class="highlight">bio: function ()</span> we can
          write <span class="highlight">bio()</span>. Like this:
        </p>
        <code>
          const person = { <br />
          name: ["Bob", "Smith"], <br />
          age: 32, <br />
          bio() { <br />
          console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years
          old.`); <br />
          }, <br />
          introduceSelf() { <br />
          console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name[0]}.`); <br />
          }, <br />
          };
        </code>
        <p>From now on, we'll use this shorter syntax.</p>
        <p>
          An object like this is referred to as an
          <strong class="bold-text">object literal</strong> — we've literally
          written out the object contents as we've come to create it. This is
          different compared to objects instantiated from classes, which we'll
          look at later on.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very common to create an object using an object literal when you
          want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some
          manner, for example sending a request to the server to be put into a
          database. Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending
          several items individually, and it is easier to work with than an
          array, when you want to identify individual items by name.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="dot_notation">
        <header class="underline">Dot notation</header>
        <p>
          Above, you accessed the object's properties and methods using
          <strong class="bold-text">dot notation</strong>. The object name
          (person) acts as the <strong class="bold-text">namespace</strong> — it
          must be entered first to access anything inside the object. Next you
          write a dot, then the item you want to access — this can be the name
          of a simple property, an item of an array property, or a call to one
          of the object's methods, for example:
        </p>
        <code>
          person.age; <br />
          person.bio();
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="objects_as_object_properties">
        <header class="underline">Objects as object properties</header>
        <p>
          An object property can itself be an object. For example, try changing
          the <span class="highlight">name</span> member from
        </p>
        <code>
          const person = { <br />
          name: ["Bob", "Smith"], <br />
          };
        </code>
        <p>to</p>
        <code>
          const person = { <br />
          name: { <br />
          first: "Bob", <br />
          last: "Smith", <br />
          }, <br />
          // … <br />
          };
        </code>
        <p>
          To access these items you just need to chain the extra step onto the
          end with another dot. Try these in the JS console:
        </p>
        <code>
          person.name.first; <br />
          person.name.last;
        </code>
        <p>
          If you do this, you'll also need to go through your method code and
          change any instances of
        </p>
        <code>
          name[0]; <br />
          name[1];
        </code>
        <p>to</p>
        <code>
          name.first; <br />
          name.last;
        </code>
        <p>Otherwise, your methods will no longer work.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="bracket_notation">
        <header class="underline">Bracket notation</header>
        <p>
          Bracket notation provides an alternative way to access object
          properties. Instead of using dot notation like this:
        </p>
        <code>
          person.age; <br />
          person.name.first;
        </code>
        <p>You can instead use square brackets:</p>
        <code>
          person["age"]; <br />
          person["name"]["first"];
        </code>
        <p>
          This looks very similar to how you access the items in an array, and
          it is basically the same thing — instead of using an index number to
          select an item, you are using the name associated with each member's
          value. It is no wonder that objects are sometimes called associative
          arrays — they map strings to values in the same way that arrays map
          numbers to values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dot notation is generally preferred over bracket notation because it
          is more succinct and easier to read. However there are some cases
          where you have to use square brackets. For example, if an object
          property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation
          to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket
          notation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the example below, the
          <span class="highlight">logProperty()</span> function can use
          <span class="highlight">person[propertyName]</span> to retrieve the
          value of the property named in
          <span class="highlight">propertyName</span>.
        </p>
        <code>
          const person = { <br />
          name: ["Bob", "Smith"], <br />
          age: 32, <br />
          }; <br />

          function logProperty(propertyName) { <br />
          console.log(person[propertyName]); <br />
          } <br />

          logProperty("name"); <br />
          // ["Bob", "Smith"] <br />
          logProperty("age"); <br />
          // 32
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="setting_object_members">
        <header class="underline">Setting object members</header>
        <p>
          So far we've only looked at retrieving (or getting) object members —
          you can also set (update) the value of object members by declaring the
          member you want to set (using dot or bracket notation), like this:
        </p>
        <code>
          person.age = 45; <br />
          person["name"]["last"] = "Cratchit";
        </code>
        <p>
          Try entering the above lines, and then getting the members again to
          see how they've changed, like so:
        </p>
        <code>
          person.age; <br />
          person["name"]["last"];
        </code>
        <p>
          Setting members doesn't just stop at updating the values of existing
          properties and methods; you can also create completely new members.
          Try these in the JS console:
        </p>
        <code>
          person["eyes"] = "hazel"; <br />
          person.farewell = function () { <br />
          console.log("Bye everybody!"); <br />
          };
        </code>
        <p>You can now test out your new members:</p>
        <code>
          person["eyes"]; <br />
          person.farewell(); <br />
          // "Bye everybody!"
        </code>
        <p>
          One useful aspect of bracket notation is that it can be used to set
          not only member values dynamically, but member names too. Let's say we
          wanted users to be able to store custom value types in their people
          data, by typing the member name and value into two text inputs. We
          could get those values like this:
        </p>
        <code>
          const myDataName = nameInput.value; <br />
          const myDataValue = nameValue.value;
        </code>
        <p>
          We could then add this new member name and value to the
          <span class="highlight">person</span> object like this:
        </p>
        <code>person[myDataName] = myDataValue;</code>
        <p>
          To test this, try adding the following lines into your code, just
          below the closing curly brace of the
          <span class="highlight">person</span> object:
        </p>
        <code>
          const myDataName = "height"; <br />
          const myDataValue = "1.75m"; <br />
          person[myDataName] = myDataValue;
        </code>
        <p>
          Now try saving and refreshing, and entering the following into your
          text input:
        </p>
        <code>person.height;</code>
        <p>
          Adding a property to an object using the method above isn't possible
          with dot notation, which can only accept a literal member name, not a
          variable value pointing to a name.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="what_is_this?">
        <header class="underline">What is "this"?</header>
        <p>
          You may have noticed something slightly strange in our methods. Look
          at this one for example:
        </p>
        <code>
          introduceSelf() { <br />
          console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name[0]}.`); <br />
          }
        </code>
        <p>
          You are probably wondering what <span class="hi`">"this"</span> is.
          The this keyword refers to the current object the code is being
          written inside — so in this case
          <span class="highlight">this</span> is equivalent to
          <span class="highlight">person</span>. So why not just write
          <span class="highlight">person</span> instead?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, when you only have to create a single object literal, it's not
          so useful. But if you create more than one,
          <span class="highlight">this</span> enables you to use the same method
          definition for every object you create.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's illustrate what we mean with a simplified pair of person
          objects:
        </p>
        <code>
          const person1 = { <br />
          name: "Chris", <br />
          introduceSelf() { <br />
          console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`); <br />
          }, <br />
          }; <br />

          const person2 = { <br />
          name: "Deepti", <br />
          introduceSelf() { <br />
          console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`); <br />
          }, <br />
          };
        </code>
        <p>
          In this case,
          <span class="highlight">person1.introduceSelf()</span> outputs "Hi!
          I'm Chris."; <span class="highlight">person2.introduceSelf()</span> on
          the other hand outputs "Hi! I'm Deepti.", even though the method's
          code is exactly the same in each case. This isn't hugely useful when
          you are writing out object literals by hand, but it will be essential
          when we start using constructors to create more than one object from a
          single object definition, and that's the subject of the next section.
